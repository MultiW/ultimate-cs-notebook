## Organization
~~Use section header "Scribbles - ..." for notes temporarily jotted down when doing projects, work, etc. These should be re-organized at a later and more appropriate time.~~

Use the ```notes``` branch to job down temporary notes while working. Merge into ```main``` after organizing and formatting the notes.
